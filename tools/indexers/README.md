# Overview

Indexers play a crucial role in organising and optimising data retrieval across various systems. They serve as navigational guides, enhancing the efficiency of data access by creating structured indexes. Within the domain of databases and information management, indexers improve query performance by providing a roadmap to swiftly locate specific blockchain data entries.

In the context of blockchain and decentralised applications, indexers take on an even more pivotal role. They facilitate streamlined access to on-chain data, encompassing transaction histories, smart contract states, and event logs. In the dynamic and decentralised blockchain ecosystem, indexers ensure real-time data updates and seamless functionality for an array of applications and platforms.

There are a number of indexer solutions available, each offering unique advantages in terms of decentralisation, ease of development, and performance. These solutions act as intermediaries, providing efficient assistance in the indexing process specifically for XDC by enabling swift and effective data access and query functionality.
