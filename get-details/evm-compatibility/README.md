# EVM Compatibility

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility is becoming increasingly important in the world of blockchain networks. It allows different blockchain networks to utilize the same tools, import code to seperate networks, allow a simple and scalable means of implemeting smart contracts into a new blockchain and allows for a standard of skills and programming in a standardize language (solidity) contracts that have been created and standardized on other networks to be easily implemented on the XDC netwrok

With EVM compatibility on the XDC network, this allows developers to use Ethereum-based programming languages and tools to build on other blockchain networks. Ethereum is currently the largest smart contract platform in the world and has a large developer community. By leveraging the EVM, developers can use familiar programming languages and tools, such as Solidity and Truffle, to create decentralized applications (DApps) on other networks. This reduces the learning curve for developers and allows for faster development times, resulting in a larger and more diverse range of applications on different networks.

Also, EVM compatibility can increase the security of blockchain networks. The EVM is an already established deterministic machine that ensures that code executes in the same way every time it is run. This means that if a smart contract runs successfully on the Ethereum network, it will also run successfully on other EVM-compatible networks. This allows for the testing of smart contracts on the Ethereum network, which is known for its high level of security, before deploying them on other networks. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities and increases the overall security of the blockchain ecosystem.

The EVM allows for the DApps created on other networks to be easily imported over to the XDC network and this allows developers who have applications on other networks to import aready established code to be faster and cheaper on the XDC network without needing to change any of their propriatarty code&#x20;

In conclusion, EVM compatibility is a critical feature on XDC that can enhance the functionalities of the XDC networks in several ways. It enables interoperability, promotes innovation and growth, increases security, and enhances scalability. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, EVM compatibility will play an increasingly important role in connecting different networks and creating a more diverse and robust ecosystem.
