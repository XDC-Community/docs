  An XDC wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store, send, and
  receive XDC tokens. These wallets are similar to traditional wallets, but they
  are digital and can be accessed from anywhere.

# XDC Wallets





XDC wallets work by utilizing public-key cryptography. When a user creates an XDC wallet, they are given a public key and a private key. The public key is used to receive XDC tokens, while the private key is used to send XDC tokens. These keys are stored in the XDC blockchain network, which is a decentralized and distributed ledger.

When a user wants to send XDC tokens to another user, they create a transaction and sign it with their private key. The transaction is then broadcasted to the XDC blockchain network, where it is verified by a network of nodes. Once the transaction is verified, the XDC tokens are transferred from the sender's wallet to the receiver's wallet.

The XDC network is EVM compatible> The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized virtual machine that was originally built on top of the Ethereum blockchain but has since been adopted by other chains and technology to leverage its functionality. The EVM is a critical component of the XDC ecosystem because it allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts on the XDC blockchain with traditionally Ethereum tool sets.

Smart contracts are  code that run on the blockchain, they are what make up Dapps, Tokens, and automated agreements on the network. They can be used to automate the execution of contracts, agreements, and other types of applications. Smart contracts are executed by the EVM, which runs on top of the XDC  blockchain.

The XDC network is fully compatible with the EVM, which means that developers can write and deploy smart contracts on the XDC network using the same tools and programming languages that they use on the Ethereum network. This is made possible by XDC's use of the Ethereum client, which provides full EVM compatibility.

XDC's compatibility with the EVM makes it easier for developers to create and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the XDC network. These dApps can be used to create new financial solutions, such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and payment systems as well as create fully autonomous start ups who leverage the blockchain infrastructure to run and scale globally..
