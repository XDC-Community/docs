# What is a Blockchain

A blockchain is a digital ledger that records and stores data in a decentralized manner. Essentially, it is a database managed by a network of computers, not a single central authority. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, along with transaction data, and a timestamp. This ensures a permanent and unalterable record of all transactions, significantly hindering any data tampering or manipulation.

A key feature of blockchain is its immutability, meaning once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. This makes it a highly secure and transparent system, which is why it has become increasingly popular in the financial industry and beyond.

Blockchains are used for a variety of purposes, including financial transactions, supply chain management, and identity verification. They can also be used to create smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into code on the blockchain.

Transactions on the network are processed, finalized, and recorded into groups called blocks. Upon creation, a block permanently records all the submitted transactions and the network's current state. A blockchainâ€™s state refers to the status of recorded data such as balances, smart contracts, and other data on the blockchain at any given time. A cryptographic hash is then created to identify that block and can be used to verify its data, and or state, at the time of that block's creation. 

The 'chain' aspect arises from the connection between blocks. When a new block is created, data from the previous block is verified through its cryptographic hash, connecting the new block to the previous block. This process continues as each block is created, moving the state of the network forward one block at a time.

The blockchain is operated by a global network of validator nodes. These nodes are computers that transact data, exchange value, and create new blocks, as described above. When a new block is created, validator nodes ensure data across the network is aligned, and they verify the history from the previous block by achieving consensus with other validator nodes.
