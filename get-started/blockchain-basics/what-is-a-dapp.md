# What is a dApp

Decentralized applications, commonly referred to as dApps, are applications that run on a decentralized blockchain network. With blockchain running on a network of nodes instead of centralized servers, applications built on blockchain operate in a decentralized environment. This allows them to be accessible by participants on the network, provides transparency, and ensures that data and transactions are not owned by one governing authority. 

A dApp’s functionality leverages a technology deployed on a blockchain called smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially collections of code that execute functions and transactions on the blockchain. As more features and capabilities are developed to operate the application, smart contracts are created to execute those functions. Ultimately, a dApp operates through a collection of smart contracts. A smart contract is a program of code and data that details the terms of a trusted agreement between parties. The smart contract is immutable, deployed to the blockchain, does not require an intermediary, and can be anonymous.

The collection of smart contracts developed to run a dApp operates on the back end of the application. So, how does one use a dApp? Users can interact with the back end through a front end user interface. When you are using an application online or on your phone, you are interacting with the front end. The front end is for interaction, while the back end executes functions and capabilities. 

Not all dApps necessarily need a front end user interface. An application simply executes a function or a need – it does not require user interaction. Even a single smart contract can be considered an application if it fulfills a need. In a blockchain ecosystem, developers can create smart contracts to cooperate and perform a system of functions. This cooperation can create an application that operates as the backend of an application or lives entirely on the blockchain.
