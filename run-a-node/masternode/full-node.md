# Full Node (Docker version)

We are going to follow these steps to set up an XDC Masternode.&#x20;

## Setting up XDC Network Masternode Docker version

The server or VPS used for the masternode should be directly facing the internet with a public IP and without NAT.&#x20;

Follow the written steps starting from step 1, or you can watch the video tutorials:

### Setting up an XDC Network Masternode via Docker

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/1A20eVTJYvs" %}

## Step 1

Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/XinFinOrg/XinFin-Node.git
```

## Step 2&#x20;

Then we change the directory to XinFin-Node

```
cd XinFin-Node
```



## Step 3&#x20;

We need to install Docker and Docker-Compose by running the following command:

```
sudo ./setup/install_docker.sh
```

## Step 4

Create a new .env file and copy the env.example file that exist in the mainnet directory. We will ensure we are in the "mainnet" directory by typing these commands. Once in edit mode for the .env file, name your masternode and use an email address in the respective fields

```
cd mainnet
cp env.example .env
nano .env                                                            
```

### For Testnet

```
cd testnet
cp env.example .env
nano .env 
```

## Step 5

### Start your Node

#### For Mainnet run the following commands:

```
cd mainnet
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

At this point you should be able to see your masternode on the list of nodes [here](https://xinfin.network/#stats) or as shown below:

For Testnet run the following commands:&#x20;

```
cd testnet
sudo docker-compose -f apothem-network.yml up -d
```

You should be able to see your node listed on the \[Apothem Network] page. Select **"Switch to LiveNet"** to check **LiveNetwork** Stats and Select **"Switch to TestNet"** for **TestNetwork.**

Your coinbase address can be found in xdcchain/coinbase.txt file.

For troubleshooting purposes, you can stop the node by using the following command on either Mainnet or Testnet:

```
sudo docker-compose -f apothem-network.yml down
```

## Downloading a Network Snapshot&#x20;

The following steps are to expedite the syncing process of your node with the XDC Network.  If you followed the steps above, your node will take 3-4 days to sync up with the network fully.  You can reduce that time by downloading a network snapshot and bringing your node back up after the chain has been downloaded and unpacked.&#x20;

### First safely bring down your node:&#x20;

```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

### Then remove the old xdchain file from the server

```
rm -rf xdcchain.tar
```

### Download the snapshot&#x20;

```
wget https://download.xinfin.network/xdcchain.tar
```

### Unpack the xdcchain.tar  file

```
tar -xvzf xdcchain.tar
```

### The unpacking will take some time, and it will look like this:&#x20;

### The following command will move the xdcchain/XDC to xdcchain/XDC\_backup

```
mv  xdcchain/XDC xdcchain/XDC_backup
```

```
mv XDC xdcchain
```

### Then we are going to remove the old "nodekey" file

```
rm -rf xdcchain/XDC/nodekey
```

### The last step is to run the bash upgrade.sh command

```
bash upgrade.sh
```

This command will bring your node up and it will start syncing to the network. Once up and running, your node will be synced to the network in just a few minutes.&#x20;
