# One-Click-Installer Masternode

## XDC One-Click Installer Set-Up

The XDC developer community has made it easy for new and existing users, even those with little or no technical expertise, to quickly set up a masternode with a simple, one-click installer.&#x20;



## Setting Up XDC One-Click Installer

1. Download the One-Click Installer: [https://xinfin.org/setup-masternode.php](https://xinfin.org/setup-masternode.php) (This option is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS)

6\. When you click "Close" it will automatically open the folder where the XDC Network files were saved. Double-click the "XinFin Network" icon as shown.  You can also find the icon on your desktop.&#x20;

8\. Wait 10-15 minutes for your node to start syncing. You will notice that it will have some peers connected and the block counts will start to increase

9\. Once we have peers and some blocks reflected on the software, we can verify our node shows up on the list of nodes online [here](https://www.apothem.network/#stats):&#x20;
